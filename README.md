Global Education (2015-2020)

This project, titled ‚ÄúGlobal Education (2015-2020)‚Äù, is an exploratory data analysis focusing on the study of education at a global level. Using datasets representing various educational metrics, such as the proportion of the population with at least a basic education and learning-adjusted years of schooling, the project aims to understand trends, disparities, and potential predictions in global education.

The analysis is conducted through various statistical and data visualization techniques, allowing for a deeper understanding of the distribution and trends in education. Special attention is also given to gender comparison in education, highlighting differences in enrollment rates and gross enrollment ratio between men and women at each educational level.

The ultimate goal of the project is to contribute to the understanding and improvement of global education, providing valuable insights for future planning and policy-making in education. Through this analysis, we hope to shed light on areas of improvement and highlight achievements in global education.

## Appendix
A linear regression model is used in this code to predict the proportion of the population without formal education for future years based on historical data. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

Library Import: The necessary libraries for data analysis and modeling are imported. pandas is used for data manipulation, numpy for mathematical operations, and LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model for the linear regression model.
Feature and Target Variable Selection: The ‚ÄòYear‚Äô feature and the ‚ÄòShare of population with no formal education, 1820-2020‚Äô target variable are selected from the df DataFrame. These are stored in X and y respectively.
Creation and Fitting of the Linear Regression Model: An instance of the LinearRegression model is created and fitted with the X and y data.
Prediction for Future Years: A numpy array is created with the future years for which predictions are to be made. Then, the fitted model is used to predict the proportion of the population without formal education for those years.
Creation of a DataFrame with Predictions: A pandas DataFrame is created with the future years and the corresponding predictions.
Printing of the Predictions DataFrame: Finally, the predictions DataFrame is printed.
In summary, this code uses a linear regression model to predict the proportion of the population without formal education for future years based on historical data.
